# feud
A web application written in Meteor to control a version of Family Feud for a school house competition.

A demo of the application is at http://hisfeud.meteor.com. To see the non-admin view (suitable for showing on a projector), 
at the console, type Session.set('isAdmin',true) to hide the admin panel.
